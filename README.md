# Parcel + A-Frame Static Site Generator

A little personal template for a small React site that can be statically hosted!


---

`yarn dev` for a development server, `yarn build` for a static build

---

TODO: Maybe replace the current `react-remarkable` with [`showdown`](http://www.showdownjs.com/), which offers more customization??
